Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a small company that wants to develop multiplayer games for use on any platform. they have an existing game that works on mobile and want to make it work on any other platformv via client-server architechture.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  utilized my personal experience in creating software documentation and using the provided client requirements to come up with solution options to acheive the end goal.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  working through the design document and concluding on OS, storage, memory requirements helps to develop the code in a manner that best suits the options decided upon.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would have a colleague more well versed in hardware come up with the server recommendations. as stated in one of the project prompts these documents are usually split between multiple team members to come up with the best set of recommendations
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I interpreted the user's needs to be that they need an app that runs on a web browser on a clients machine, but performs all the logic and connecting various users together on a centeralized server. It is important to consider the user's needs because if you do not then they will not want to pay for your services.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  one must always be able to gather as much relevant information from the client as possible to find out exactly what they need before you start. it is also important to know that the client will usually only have a vague idea about what they need and it is your job to translate these vague requirements into a full implementation; keeping a dialog running with the client can be helpful.
